# Sitov Language Academy — Pedagogy & UI/UX Research

> **Aussprache-Update (2026-09-06):** Die Tonspur im Aussprache-Trainer visualisiert echte Audiodaten (`AnalyserNode`: Lautstärke + Stimmlage) – bei der Live-Aufnahme und bei der Wiedergabe. Übungssätze liegen je CEFR-Familie (A1–C2) vor und werden nur für das freigeschaltete Niveau geladen. Referenzhören: native Audio-URL mit Echtzeit-Welle, sonst langsame deutsche Sprachausgabe.

> **i18n-Update (2026-09-06):** Die Oberflächensprache folgt der bei der Registrierung gewählten Erstsprache und wird nach dem Login automatisch gesetzt; im Profil ist sie jederzeit über einen Sprachumschalter änderbar (Endonyme, große Bedienelemente). Grundsatz: Kein interner Fallback-String darf ungeübersetzt in der UI erscheinen – alle sieben Übersetzer-Sektionen sind in allen fünf Sprachen (de/en/uk/ru/tr) vollständig zu pflegen (Audit siehe `CURRENT_STATE.md` 1a). Routen-Segmente in Breadcrumbs müssen stets übersetzte Namen zeigen (`DASHBOARD_ROUTE_KEYS`).

> **UX-Update (2026-09-06):** Mobile-First-Konventionen präzisiert (siehe `CURRENT_STATE.md` 1a): (1) Hover-Effekte gelten nur auf echten Zeigegeräten (`@media (hover: hover)` via Tailwind `hoverOnlyWhenSupported`); auf Touch gibt es nur kurzes `:active`-Druck-Feedback. (2) Großflächige Hintergründe als reiner CSS-Verlauf (kein Bild) gegen Color-Banding. (3) Im aktiven Lernmodus zählt „Karte + Aktion ohne Scrollen sichtbar": zusammengeführte Navigation, einzeilige Meta-Info, vertikal zentrierte 100dvh-Karte; Erklärtexte gehören ausschließlich in die Übersicht vor dem Start.

**Research date:** 02 September 2026  
**Target group:** learners in later adulthood / “Lernende im besten Alter”  
**Purpose:** Master-guideline for frontend engineering, UX/UI, instructional design and content creation

> **Evidence principle:** This document separates (1) normative accessibility requirements, (2) empirical findings, and (3) project-specific design recommendations. A value such as `18px body text` is therefore not presented as a WCAG requirement unless WCAG actually specifies it.

> **Master-file status:** This is the canonical merged guideline for Sitov Language Academy. It combines the original geragogic/UI research with the supplied architecture-validation notes (Stripe webhooks, Supabase SSR, Next.js caching). Where the two source texts conflict, the master adopts the strongest evidence-backed or vendor-current rule and records the decision explicitly.

### Master merge decisions

| Topic | Canonical decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| phase6 intervals | **1 → 3 → 9 → 29 → 90 days** after the initial same-day Phase-1 review | Matches phase6's current published system description; the supplied 10/30-day variant is not retained as the default. citehttps://www.phase-6.de/help/knowledge-base/phase6-systematik/ citehttps://www.phase-six.com/presse/classic-lernen/ |
| Wrong answer | Move back **one phase**, minimum Phase 1 | This is the phase6 rule and also supports low-pressure geragogic UX. citehttps://www.phase-6.de/help/knowledge-base/phase6-systematik/ |
| Touch targets | **48×48 CSS px** project default; 56px primary action where feasible | Exceeds WCAG 2.2 AA's 24×24 minimum and aligns with the original research synthesis for older users. citehttps://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum |
| Stripe webhook runtime | **Node.js runtime is the conservative project standard** for `stripe-node` webhook verification | Stripe's official Next.js example uses the Node-oriented SDK with a raw request body; the security invariant is preserving the exact raw body. citehttps://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/signature?lang=node citehttps://github.com/stripe/stripe-node/blob/master/examples/webhook-signing/nextjs/app/api/webhooks/route.ts |
| Next.js protected routes | Do **not** rely on an old blanket rule that every authenticated page must use `force-dynamic`. Use the rendering model appropriate to the deployed Next.js version; with **Next.js 16 + Cache Components**, `dynamic='force-dynamic'` is not needed and the framework instead supports mixing static shells with dynamic runtime data. | Current Next.js 16 documentation explicitly states that Cache Components changes this model. citehttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/partial-prerendering |
| Shared caching of user data | Never cache personalized data in a shared cache key; pass user identity into cacheable functions only where the resulting key is explicitly user-scoped, or keep the computation outside shared cache. | Prevents cross-user data leakage and is compatible with Next.js's current granular cache model. citehttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache |

## 0. Executive design doctrine

Sitov Language Academy should be designed as a **calm, predictable, forgiving learning environment** rather than as a conventional “gameified” language app.

The core design logic is:

1. **Reduce sensory friction:** large readable text, high contrast, generous spacing, clear controls and no dependence on color alone.
2. **Reduce interaction precision demands:** large targets and a non-drag alternative for every dragging interaction.
3. **Reduce working-memory burden:** one task intention per screen, stable navigation, contextual instructions, progressive disclosure and minimal simultaneous choices.
4. **Exploit existing knowledge:** connect new vocabulary to familiar people, places, routines, objects, stories and life situations rather than treating every word as decontextualized symbol memorization.
5. **Use retrieval + spacing, not massed repetition:** the learning engine should make the next review happen when the item is due, while keeping the interface emotionally neutral when an item is difficult.
6. **Reward mastery and continuity, not speed:** progress feedback, personal milestones and completion rituals are preferable to countdowns, leaderboards and public comparison.
7. **Make success visible:** every session should end with a clear statement of what the learner accomplished and what happens next.
8. **Treat accessibility as the default product architecture:** WCAG 2.2 AA should be the baseline, with selected AAA practices adopted where they materially benefit this audience.

W3C explicitly notes that ageing can affect vision, dexterity, hearing and short-term memory/concentration, and that the existing accessibility standards cover many of these needs. citehttps://www.w3.org/WAI/older-users/

---

### Content access model (decision, 2026-09-06)

Sitov Language Academy does **not** use a self-service Free/Premium paywall for learning content. Access to paid CEFR levels is **granted per user by an admin/teacher** and stored in `profiles.allowed_levels` (fine-grained sub-levels `A1.1 … B1.2`). Newly registered learners start with **no** paid-level access; an admin enables the appropriate levels. Admin/teacher roles retain full access. This is consistent with the calm, teacher-guided doctrine (the school decides who is ready for which level) and avoids upsell pressure in the learner UI. The public course-booking flow (real presence/online courses, via Stripe) remains a separate, unaffected business process. Implementation: `lib/access/levels.ts`, `lib/access/server.ts`, the level route-guard `app/[lang]/dashboard/level/[level]/layout.tsx`, and the admin toggle UI in `components/admin/StudentList.tsx`.

# 1. UI/UX guidelines for learners in later adulthood

## 1.1 User model: design for capability diversity, not “senior simplicity”

Older adulthood is not a homogeneous user segment. Some users will have excellent vision, motor control and digital literacy; others may have reduced contrast sensitivity, slower processing, reduced working memory, hand tremor, reduced dexterity or less familiarity with digital interaction.

W3C’s ageing guidance describes declining contrast sensitivity, near-focus, fine motor control, concentration and short-term memory as common age-related factors affecting web use. It therefore recommends applying accessible web design rather than creating a completely separate “senior technology” paradigm. citehttps://www.w3.org/WAI/older-users/

### Product implication

Build **adaptive accessibility** into the product from the beginning:

- text-size control (`100%`, `125%`, `150%`, `175%`, `200%`)
- optional high-contrast mode
- optional increased-spacing mode
- keyboard accessibility throughout
- optional text-to-speech / read-aloud for instructions and target language
- no interaction that depends exclusively on a gesture, color, hover or sound
- persistent navigation and stable control placement

Do not label these settings “senior mode”. They should be ordinary personalization features.

---

## 1.2 Visual design specification

### 1.2.1 Typography — normative baseline vs. project standard

WCAG 2.2 does **not** prescribe one universal font size. It requires that text can be resized to at least 200% without loss of content or functionality. W3C specifically recommends relative sizing and scalable layouts. citehttps://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/resize-text

A systematic review of font-size research for older adults found that larger type was generally preferred, while also noting that excessively large text can eventually reduce readability. In one classic online-text study, 14-point text was more legible than 12-point text for older participants. citehttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9376262/ citehttps://doi.org/10.1145/634067.634173

### **Sitov project standard**

Use the following as the **default design system**, not merely as the minimum accessible version. The student learning shell (Dashboard, Niveau, Videos, Profil, Übungen, Vokabeltrainer, Aussprache) follows this on 375px: stacked header, 48px targets, full-width primary actions, no hover-only controls.

| Token | CSS | Recommendation |
|---|---:|---|
| Body text | `1.125rem` = 18px | Default paragraph/instruction size |
| Secondary text | `1rem` = 16px | Only for low-priority metadata; never for core instructions |
| Large UI labels | `1.25rem` = 20px | Buttons, action labels where space permits |
| Task question | `1.5rem` = 24px | Main exercise prompt |
| Target vocabulary | `2rem` = 32px | Flashcard headword / answer reveal |
| H1 | `2rem–2.5rem` = 32–40px | Page-level headings |
| H2 | `1.5rem–1.875rem` = 24–30px | Section headings |
| Small legal/meta text | `0.875rem` = 14px | Only non-essential metadata, never required learning content |

**Important:** the 18–20px recommendation is a product accessibility decision based on the older-adult literature, not a WCAG minimum.

### 1.2.2 Font family

Default to a highly legible, neutral sans-serif with distinct glyphs, e.g.:

```css
font-family:
  Inter,
  system-ui,
  -apple-system,
  BlinkMacSystemFont,
  "Segoe UI",
  sans-serif;
```

Avoid decorative fonts and condensed faces. Do not use all-caps for sentences or instructions.

Research comparing serif and sans-serif online text in older users found a clear benefit from larger size, with 14-point text outperforming 12-point text; 12-point serif text was also slower to read than 14-point serif or sans-serif conditions. citehttps://doi.org/10.1145/634067.634173

### 1.2.3 Line height and paragraph spacing

W3C’s AAA Visual Presentation guidance specifies line spacing of at least 1.5 times the font size and paragraph spacing of at least 1.5 times the line spacing. It also recommends lines no longer than 80 characters and discourages full justification. citehttps://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/visual-presentation

### **Sitov project standard**

```css
body {
  font-size: 1.125rem;      /* 18px */
  line-height: 1.6;
  letter-spacing: 0.01em;
}

p + p {
  margin-top: 1.5rem;
}

.reading-column {
  max-width: 70ch;
}

.reading-column {
  text-align: left;
}
```

Target **60–75 characters per line** for instructional text. Do not justify body copy.

A study of web accessibility for older adults found that older participants preferred 1.5x or double line spacing over single spacing, even where performance differences were small. citehttps://pure.york.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/web-accessibility-for-older-adults-effects-of-line-spacing-and-te/

### 1.2.4 Contrast

WCAG 2.2 AA requires:

- **4.5:1** minimum contrast for normal text
- **3:1** for large text
- **3:1** for meaningful non-text UI graphics/components

The WCAG rationale explicitly notes that 4.5:1 compensates for contrast sensitivity loss associated with moderate visual impairment and ageing. citehttps://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html

### **Sitov project standard**

For primary instructional content, aim for **at least 7:1** whenever visually practical. This is particularly appropriate for body text and important prompts because the WCAG AAA threshold is 7:1 for normal text. Do not use pale gray as instructional text.

For component boundaries, selected states and icons that communicate functionality, use **≥3:1** against adjacent colors, per WCAG 2.2 SC 1.4.11. citehttps://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html

### 1.2.5 Color

Color must never be the only carrier of meaning. Add text, icons, position, borders or patterns. WCAG SC 1.4.1 explicitly prohibits color-only communication. citehttps://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/use-of-color

**Good:**

> ✓ Gewusst — correct
>
> The correct state is indicated by icon + text + visual emphasis.

**Bad:**

> a green card = correct; a red card = incorrect

without any text/icon distinction.

### 1.2.6 Backgrounds and decorative imagery

Keep instructional backgrounds visually quiet. Avoid:

- patterned backgrounds behind text
- moving backgrounds
- excessive gradients
- decorative animations competing with the exercise prompt
- large visual elements that have no instructional purpose

The W3C ageing literature repeatedly emphasizes legible layout, clear organization and avoiding distractions/irrelevant movement. citehttps://www.w3.org/WAI/older-users/literature/

---

## 1.3 Touch and pointer interaction

### 1.3.1 Minimum target size

WCAG 2.2 introduces **SC 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum)** at AA: targets should be at least **24×24 CSS px**, with exceptions where spacing, equivalent alternatives or other conditions satisfy the criterion. citehttps://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum

WCAG’s AAA **Target Size (Enhanced)** specifies **44×44 CSS px**. W3C explicitly describes this as helping people with hand tremor, limited dexterity and difficulty with fine motor movement. citehttps://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-enhanced

Older-adult touchscreen research has found performance benefits from larger buttons. One study reported better efficiency/error performance around 15 mm buttons with spacing between adjacent buttons; another found 16 mm image buttons with 22-point text to be effective. citehttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169814121001542 citehttps://www.mdpi.com/2411-9660/3/3/35

### **Sitov project standard**

Use **48×48 CSS px** as the default minimum for all primary touch targets.

Use **56px high** for the main action button in learning exercises whenever layout permits.

Recommended spacing:

- minimum gap between adjacent primary controls: **12px**
- preferred gap: **16px**
- destructive/irreversible actions: separate clearly from primary action by **24px+** visual space

```css
.button {
  min-width: 48px;
  min-height: 48px;
  padding: 0.75rem 1rem;
}

.primary-action {
  min-height: 56px;
  padding-inline: 1.25rem;
}
```

This deliberately exceeds WCAG AA and aligns the interaction model with the motor-control needs described in ageing research.

### 1.3.2 Drag-and-drop: do not make dragging mandatory

WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.7 requires that functionality using dragging can also be achieved by a single-pointer operation unless dragging is essential. citehttps://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dragging-movements

This is not merely a compliance detail. Older-adult touchscreen research demonstrates that higher positioning accuracy requirements in drag-and-drop increase errors and supplementary gestures; lowering the accuracy requirement improved accessibility for participants with different dexterity and experience profiles. citehttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915031270

### **Design rule: Tap-to-select first**

For matching or ordering tasks, use:

1. **Tap item A**
2. Item A receives a clear selected state
3. **Tap destination B**
4. The pair/order is committed
5. Undo remains available

Do not require:

- long-press + drag
- fine positioning of a card into a small drop zone
- dragging through a crowded layout
- holding a finger down while simultaneously navigating

Dragging may exist as an optional enhancement, but it must never be the only path.

---

## 1.4 Cognitive load and screen architecture

Cognitive Load Theory treats working memory as limited. For older learners, age-related reductions in working-memory and processing resources can make unnecessarily complex instructional presentations more demanding. Research on cognitive ageing and instructional design argues for using established instructional-design principles that efficiently manage available cognitive resources. citehttps://doi.org/10.1007/s10648-006-9005-4

Systematic work on multimedia learning identifies **modality, signaling, coherence and segmentation/chunking** as frequently studied design principles, while warning that irrelevant details can add extraneous load. citehttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013151930171X

### **Screen-level rules**

One exercise screen should normally contain:

- one learning objective
- one instruction
- one main interaction
- one primary action to continue
- at most one secondary help mechanism

Avoid presenting six or more competing controls around an exercise.

### **Stable spatial schema**

Keep these regions stable throughout the platform:

```text
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ← Zurück      Lektion 3             │  Header
├──────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                      │
│  Was bedeutet „appointment“?         │  Main task
│                                      │
│  [ answer area / options ]           │
│                                      │
│             [ Prüfen ]               │  Primary action
│                                      │
│  ? Tipp                              │  Optional support
├──────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Fortschritt: 7 von 10               │  Persistent context
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The learner should not have to rediscover where the “Continue” action is on each screen.

W3C’s specific guidance for older users stresses clear navigation, page organization and consistent navigation/identification. citehttps://www.w3.org/WAI/older-users/developing/

---

## 1.5 Instructions: one action at a time

Bad:

> “Read the sentence, select the correct article, drag it into the blank, then press the green button to continue.”

Better:

> **1. Wähle den passenden Artikel.**  
> Tippe auf **der**, **die** oder **das**.

Then let the interface reveal step 2.

### Instruction template

**Question:** what are you solving?  
**Action:** what must I do?  
**Constraint:** only when needed.  
**Feedback:** what happens next?

Example:

> **Welches Wort passt?**  
> Tippe auf die richtige Antwort.

Avoid technical interaction language such as “drag”, “swipe left”, “hover over”, unless that exact interaction is necessary.

---

# 2. Error-tolerant (“Zero-Error UX”) design

## 2.1 Goal

The product should behave as though mistakes are **expected learning events**, not failures of intelligence or ability.

W3C requires automatically detected input errors to be identified in text and, where known, offers suggestions for correction. citehttps://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/error-suggestion.html

For important submissions, WCAG also encourages reversal, checking or confirmation before consequences are finalized. citehttps://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/error-prevention-legal-financial-data.html

### Learning-specific translation

Do not display:

> ✗ Falsch!

Use:

> **Noch nicht — wir üben das Wort gleich noch einmal.**  
> Die richtige Antwort ist: **appointment = Termin**

Then provide a meaningful cue:

> **Merksatz:** “I have an appointment at 10.” = “Ich habe um 10 Uhr einen Termin.”

This reframes the error as a scheduled learning event.

---

## 2.2 Error feedback pattern

### Recommended 5-step feedback sequence

1. **Neutral acknowledgement**
   - “Noch nicht.”
2. **Correct answer**
   - “Die Lösung ist: …”
3. **Meaningful context**
   - short example sentence
4. **Optional audio**
   - “Anhören”
5. **Next step**
   - “Wir sehen dieses Wort später noch einmal.”

Avoid modal error dialogs that block the learner.

### Feedback tone matrix

| Situation | Avoid | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Wrong answer | “Falsch!” | “Noch nicht.” |
| Several errors | “Du machst viele Fehler.” | “Diese Wörter brauchen noch etwas Übung.” |
| No answer | “Ungültige Eingabe.” | “Wähle bitte eine Antwort.” |
| Empty lesson | “Keine Daten.” | “Hier wartet noch kein Lernstoff. Wähle eine Lektion.” |
| Interrupted session | “Session verloren.” | “Willkommen zurück. Wir machen dort weiter, wo du aufgehört hast.” |
| No reviews due | “Nichts zu tun.” | “Heute sind keine Wiederholungen fällig. Du hast frei.” |

---

## 2.3 Empty states

Every empty state must answer:

1. **Where am I?**
2. **Why is it empty?**
3. **What can I do now?**

### Example — no vocabulary due

> **Heute ist nichts fällig.**  
> Deine bisher gelernten Wörter sind gut im Zeitplan.  
> [ Eine neue Lektion starten ]

### Example — no completed lessons

> **Dein Lernweg beginnt hier.**  
> Starte mit deiner ersten kurzen Lektion. Sie dauert nur etwa 10 Minuten.  
> [ Erste Lektion starten ]

---

# 3. Vokabeltraining nach Phase-6 / Leitner-Prinzip

## 3.1 Important distinction: “Leitner” is a family of schedules, not one universal table

The classic Leitner approach is a box system in which correct cards move to a later box and incorrect cards return to an earlier box. The exact intervals are configurable and are not universally fixed by the term “Leitner”.

**phase6**, however, documents its own concrete phase schedule.

The current phase6 Help Center states that the product uses six standard learning phases, with increasing intervals, and that an incorrectly answered item is moved back by **one phase** rather than reset all the way to the beginning. citehttps://www.phase-6.de/help/knowledge-base/phase6-systematik/

The phase6 product documentation gives the standard schedule explicitly: Phase 1 is due on the current day; Phase 2 after 1 day; then 3, 9, 29 and 90 days. Correct completion of the sequence takes **132 days** before the item reaches long-term memory. citehttps://www.phase-six.com/presse/classic-lernen/

### 3.1.1 Exact phase6 default schedule

| Phase | Status | Next review after correct answer | Meaning |
|---:|---|---:|---|
| 1 | initial learning | same day | first retrieval |
| 2 | early consolidation | **1 day** | next day |
| 3 | consolidation | **3 days** | short spacing |
| 4 | strengthening | **9 days** | increasing spacing |
| 5 | stabilization | **29 days** | medium-term retrieval |
| 6 | long-term check | **90 days** | long-interval retrieval |
| LT | long-term memory | not scheduled in standard flow | learning objective reached |

### 3.1.2 Failure transition

According to phase6’s current description:

> **Wrong/variant answer → move back by one phase**

This is crucial UX-wise. The design should communicate a **local correction**, not “everything is lost”. citehttps://www.phase-6.de/help/knowledge-base/phase6-systematik/

### Example state transitions

```text
Phase 1 --correct--> Phase 2
Phase 2 --correct--> Phase 3
Phase 3 --correct--> Phase 4
Phase 4 --correct--> Phase 5
Phase 5 --correct--> Phase 6
Phase 6 --correct--> Long-Term Memory

Phase 6 --wrong--> Phase 5
Phase 5 --wrong--> Phase 4
Phase 4 --wrong--> Phase 3
Phase 3 --wrong--> Phase 2
Phase 2 --wrong--> Phase 1
Phase 1 --wrong--> Phase 1
```

This should be implemented as an explicit **state machine**, not as scattered timing logic.

### 3.1.3 Implementierungsstand im Repository (umgesetzt)

Die Zustandsmaschine liegt vollständig in `lib/leitner.ts` und wird von Server Actions und UI nur aufgerufen – es gibt keine verstreute Intervall-Arithmetik.

- **Persistenz:** `user_vocabulary_progress.box_number` trägt die Phase. `1–6` sind die aktiven Lernphasen, `7` entspricht dem terminalen Zustand „Long-Term Memory" und wird nicht mehr abgefragt. Der bestehende CHECK `(1..7)` und die Abfrage `box_number < 7` bleiben unverändert gültig, die Umstellung ist daher rückwärtskompatibel.
- **Ruhezeiten beim Eintritt in eine Phase:** Phase 1 = 1 Tag, Phase 2 = 1 Tag, Phase 3 = 3, Phase 4 = 9, Phase 5 = 29, Phase 6 = 90 Tage. Phase 1 wird mit einem Tag statt „heute" angesetzt, damit eine Vokabel nach einem Fehler nicht in derselben Session erneut erscheint – das wäre für die Zielgruppe eher Frust als Wiederholung.
- **Fehler-Regel:** Eine falsche Antwort setzt die Vokabel **exakt eine Phase** zurück, Untergrenze Phase 1. Nichts wird zurückgesetzt oder gelöscht. Eine bereits gelernte Karte (`box_number = 7`) landet zurück in Phase 5.
- **Kontrastive Anpassung:** Ist eine Vokabel für die Muttersprache des Lernenden als schwer markiert (`is_hard_for_ru` / `is_hard_for_tr`), wird die Ruhezeit halbiert (mindestens 1 Tag). Muttersprache und Schwierigkeitsmerkmal werden serverseitig aus Profil und Karte gelesen, nie vom Client übernommen.
- **Telemetrie:** `lapses` zählt jede Rückstufung, `last_answered_at` hält den letzten Antwortzeitpunkt. Beides ist die Datenbasis, um `is_hard_for_*` künftig automatisch zu pflegen.
- **Kommunikation im UI (lokale Korrektur, nicht Totalverlust):** Nach jeder Antwort erklärt ein Satz in Klartext, was passiert ist – „Zurück in Phase 3. Du siehst diese Vokabel morgen wieder." bzw. „Weiter in Phase 4. Wiederholung in 9 Tagen." Kein rotes Fehler-Feedback, kein Timer, keine Bestenliste. Der Lernende bestätigt selbst mit „Nächste Karte" (Touch-Target ab 64px).
- **Absicherung:** `__tests__/leitner.test.ts` prüft Intervalltabelle, Aufstieg, Übergang nach Long-Term, die Ein-Phasen-Rückstufung über alle Phasen, die Untergrenze Phase 1 und die Neuberechnung für Altbestände.

---

## 3.2 Why spacing works

A large research literature supports combining **spacing** and **retrieval practice** rather than repeatedly restudying the same material in one massed block. A major review in *Nature Reviews Psychology* summarizes these two strategies across domains and across the lifespan. citehttps://doi.org/10.1038/s44159-022-00089-1

For second-language vocabulary specifically, research has found that introducing spacing produces substantial learning benefits, while evidence about the exact optimal schedule remains more nuanced. An L2 vocabulary study found a limited advantage for expanding spacing over equal spacing, but the amount of spacing itself had a larger effect. citehttps://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/studies-in-second-language-acquisition/article/effects-of-expanding-and-equal-spacing-on-second-language-vocabulary-learning/D1D796306985C52F9BE7A1200AC50DB9

Long-term longitudinal vocabulary research also found strong retention benefits from longer intervals between relearning sessions. citehttps://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/psychological-science/j.1467-9280.1993.tb00571.x/

### Design conclusion

Do not optimize primarily for “how many words did the learner complete today?”. Optimize for **probability of later retrieval**.

  phase: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | "long-term";
  nextReviewAt: string | null;      // ISO timestamp
  lastReviewedAt?: string;
  correctCount: number;
  incorrectCount: number;
  consecutiveCorrect: number;
}
```

### Transition function

```ts
const intervalsDays = {
  1: 0,
  2: 1,
  3: 3,
  4: 9,
  5: 29,
  6: 90,
};

function review(item: VocabularyItem, correct: boolean) {
  if (correct) {
    if (item.phase === 6) {
      return { ...item, phase: "long-term", nextReviewAt: null };
    }
    const nextPhase = (item.phase + 1) as 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6;
    return {
      ...item,
      phase: nextPhase,
      nextReviewAt: addDays(now(), intervalsDays[nextPhase]),
      correctCount: item.correctCount + 1,
      consecutiveCorrect: item.consecutiveCorrect + 1,
    };
  }

  const previousPhase = Math.max(1, Number(item.phase) - 1) as 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;
  return {
    ...item,
    phase: previousPhase,
    nextReviewAt: addDays(now(), intervalsDays[previousPhase]),
    incorrectCount: item.incorrectCount + 1,
    consecutiveCorrect: 0,
  };
}
```

**Engineering note:** normalize timestamps to a consistent timezone strategy and define the “day boundary” explicitly. For a user-friendly product, “tomorrow” should mean the next calendar day in the learner’s locale rather than exactly +24h.

## 3.4 Phase visualization for older learners

Do **not** visualize the system as a failure staircase.

Bad:

> “You fell from level 6 to level 5.”

Better:

> **Dieses Wort braucht noch etwas Festigung.**  
> Wir sehen es wieder, bevor es vergessen wird.

### Recommended progress representation

Use a **journey metaphor**, not a ranking metaphor:

```text
Wortreise

① Kennenlernen   ●
② Wiedersehen    ●
③ Festigen       ●
④ Sicherer       ●
⑤ Fast dauerhaft ●
⑥ Langzeit       ○
```

When an answer is wrong:

```text
„Wir geben dem Wort noch eine zusätzliche Übung.“
```

Do not decrement a percentage such as “86% → 72%” after a single mistake. That creates the appearance of loss.

### Better metrics

Show:

- `Heute gelernt: 12 Wörter`
- `Heute wiederholt: 18 Wörter`
- `Bereits langfristig sicher: 143 Wörter`
- `Nächste Wiederholung: morgen`

Hide or de-emphasize:

- error counts as negative score
- rankings
- comparative percentiles
- “streak broken” warnings

---

## 3.5 Vary retrieval direction

phase6 documentation notes that its system can vary review order and direction. citehttps://www.phase-6.dewww.phase-6.de/classic/lerninhalte/vokabeltrainer/german-as-foreign-language/VHS/

For Sitov Language Academy, a vocabulary item should eventually be retrievable in both directions where pedagogically relevant:

- German → target language
- target language → German
- audio → meaning
- image/context → word
- word → sentence completion

Do not introduce all directions at once. Increase difficulty progressively.

---

# 4. Exercise architecture

## 4.1 Task selection principle

Choose interaction types that maximize:

**learning value / motor burden**

rather than maximizing visual novelty.

For this audience, a good digital exercise is:

- large targets
- one obvious instruction
- limited simultaneous choices
- immediate feedback
- easy undo/retry
- no fine positioning requirement
- no time limit
- meaningful context

---

## 4.2 Exercise concept A — Tap-to-select vocabulary recognition

### Goal
Fast receptive vocabulary retrieval.

### UI

```text
Was bedeutet „appointment“?

┌────────────────┐
│   Termin       │
└────────────────┘

┌────────────────┐
│   Einladung    │
└────────────────┘

┌────────────────┐
│   Reise        │
└────────────────┘

             [ Prüfen ]
```

### Rules

- 3 options for early learners
- 4 options after mastery
- each option ≥56px high
- no countdown
- after tap: selected option remains highlighted
- “Prüfen” remains available instead of auto-submitting immediately

### Pedagogical rationale

Recognition is less demanding than free production, so use this as a scaffold before productive recall.

---

## 4.3 Exercise concept B — Sentence gap with contextual cue

### Goal
Move vocabulary from isolated recognition into usable language.

Example:

> **Ich habe morgen einen ______ beim Zahnarzt.**

Options:

- Termin
- Urlaub
- Koffer

Optional support:

> **Tipp:** “appointment” = ein geplanter Termin

After answer:

> **Sehr gut.**  
> “appointment” = “Termin”

Then audio:

> 🔊 “I have an appointment tomorrow.”

### Why this matters for older learners

Existing knowledge and life experience can support learning. Research on adult learning has shown that prior knowledge and crystallized intelligence are important predictors of knowledge acquisition, while research on later-life learning emphasizes that real-life contexts allow older learners to draw on accumulated knowledge, expertise and strategies. citehttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16029097/ citehttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41239-017-0055-0

---

## 4.4 Exercise concept C — Tap-to-order sentence builder

### Goal
Practice syntax without dragging.

Prompt:

> **Baue den Satz.**

```text
[ morgen ] [ ich ] [ einen Termin ] [ habe ]
```

Interaction:

1. Tap “ich”
2. Tap “habe”
3. Tap “morgen”
4. Tap “einen Termin”
5. Continue

The selected sequence appears in a dedicated answer lane.

### Why not drag?

Because WCAG 2.2 requires a single-pointer alternative for dragging functionality, and older-adult touchscreen research shows that reducing precision requirements reduces errors. citehttps://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dragging-movements citehttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915031270

---

## 4.5 Exercise concept D — Life-experience association card

### Goal
Exploit semantic and autobiographical associations.

Prompt:

> **Wo könnte dir dieses Wort begegnen?**

Word: **reservation**

Choose one:

- Restaurant
- Busfahrt
- Arzttermin
- **Alle drei**

Then prompt:

> **Kennst du eine persönliche Situation dazu?**

Optional one-line response or voice recording.

### Design rationale

A 2025 review on older-adult education argues that crystallized intelligence — knowledge and skills acquired over life — remain comparatively strong and that older adults may rely more on this knowledge base during learning. citehttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03601277.2025.2569386

Language-learning research with older adults also emphasizes comprehension, speaking development, self-awareness, motivation and cognitive/memory strategies as relevant to autonomous learning. citehttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X23000520

### Important nuance

Do not turn “life experience” into a compulsory personal disclosure. Associations can be fictional, generic or culturally neutral.

---

# 5. Positive feedback and low-pressure gamification

## 5.1 Evidence base

A systematic review of gamification for older adults identified only a small body of research and concluded that results were generally positive but often weak because of methodological limitations. Importantly, the evidence base was dominated by health-related interventions, so claims about language learning must be made cautiously. citehttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8437506/

A 2024 systematic review specifically on gamification and language learning in adults aged 50+ highlights the growing research interest but should likewise not be interpreted as proof that every common gamification mechanic improves language outcomes. citehttps://doi.org/10.1089/g4h.2024.0025

Older-adult user research on cognitive-training technology has found that participants often care more about tangible evidence of progress and useful feedback than abstract badges or tokens. Competitive elements such as leaderboards have also been viewed critically in older-adult interface research. citehttps://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/64/2/gnad048/7142548 citehttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/42201185/

### Product conclusion

Use **gameful feedback**, not **game pressure**.

---

## 5.2 Allowed motivational mechanics

### A. Personal progress

> “Du kennst jetzt 84 Wörter sicher.”

Use absolute mastery counts and completed learning milestones.

### B. Gentle continuity indicators

Instead of a punitive streak:

> **Diese Woche 4 Lernmomente**

No “streak broken” warning.

A missed day should never erase visible achievement.

### C. Achievement badges

Use competence-oriented badges:

- “Erste 25 Wörter”
- “Erste ganze Lektion abgeschlossen”
- “10 Gespräche geübt”
- “5 schwierige Wörter erfolgreich gefestigt”

Avoid juvenile badge language or cartoonish reward loops.

### D. Milestone celebrations

Use short, calm celebrations:

> **Geschafft.**  
> Diese Lektion ist abgeschlossen.

Animation ≤300–500ms and optional under reduced-motion settings.

### E. Personal goals

Let the learner select:

- 5 min / day
- 10 min / day
- 15 min / day

But never punish the user for selecting a smaller goal.

---

## 5.3 Explicitly prohibited mechanics

Do **not** use:

- countdown timers for ordinary language exercises
- “time remaining” displays
- expiring answer windows
- energy/life systems
- public leaderboards
- “you lost your streak” warnings
- negative points after mistakes
- hearts/lives that can run out
- red flashing failure states
- forced competition with peers

WCAG’s “Enough Time” principle requires appropriate handling of time limits, and W3C’s ageing guidance emphasizes the importance of sufficient time and avoiding unnecessary distraction. citehttps://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/ citehttps://www.w3.org/WAI/older-users/developing/

---

## 5.4 Self-Determination Theory as the motivational model

For older learners, design should support:

- **Autonomy:** meaningful choices, pace control, optional hints
- **Competence:** visible progress, achievable tasks, specific feedback
- **Relatedness:** optional social or tutor connection

Research with older adults on technology use links navigability, interactivity and customizability with autonomy/competence/relatedness and intrinsic motivation. citehttps://aging.jmir.org/2024/1/e56923

### UI consequence

A good session ending is:

> **Heute hast du 12 Wörter geübt.**  
> 9 davon waren bereits sicher. 3 sehen wir später noch einmal.  
> **Nächster Schritt:** Morgen warten 7 Wiederholungen auf dich.

This reinforces competence and predictability without pressure.

---

# 6. Microlearning and pacing

## 6.1 Evidence: there is no scientifically universal “ideal number of minutes”

It would be misleading to claim that older learners universally perform best with exactly 10, 15 or 20 minutes. The literature defines microlearning in a range of short units rather than one universally optimal duration.

A 2024 systematic review of 40 microlearning studies describes microlearning as targeted, action-oriented, bite-sized learning delivered over seconds or minutes and reports generally positive effects, while explicitly noting that the exact duration is context-dependent. citehttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39882484/

For older learners, current educational research supports chunking and external supports, while also emphasizing that chunking must not be implemented mechanically if it increases the need to hold and inhibit multiple fragments of information. citehttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9394220/ citehttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131511001898

### Therefore, Sitov uses a **design range**, not a fake “scientific optimum”.

---

## 6.2 Recommended pacing model

### One micro-activity

**2–5 minutes**

Example:

- 8 vocabulary recalls
- 1 example sentence
- 1 short spoken repetition

### One lesson

**8–15 minutes**

Suggested composition:

```text
1 min   Orientation
3 min   Learn / explain
3–5 min Guided practice
2–4 min Retrieval
1 min   Recap / next step
```

### Optional extended session

Allow several lessons to be chained into a **20–30 minute session**, but insert a natural stopping point every 8–15 minutes.

### Explicit design principle

The learner should be able to stop after one micro-lesson and still feel successful.

---

## 6.3 Pacing control belongs to the learner

Never auto-advance faster than the learner can comfortably read.

Use:

- [Weiter]
- [Noch einmal]
- [Tipp]
- [Aussprache hören]

Avoid:

- auto-advance after 1 second
- timed narration
- disappearing hints
- animated transitions that delay the next control

For multimedia instruction, evidence indicates that older adults can benefit from support across modalities; one study found older participants learned best when narration was paired with redundant on-screen text rather than audio-only or complementary-image conditions. citehttps://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01076/full

### Practical implementation

For core instructions:

- show text
- optionally read the same text aloud
- let the learner replay it
- do not make audio the only source of essential information

---

# 7. Learning-path information architecture

## 7.1 Recommended hierarchy

```text

│   └── Schwierig
│
└── Mein Fortschritt
    ├── Gelernte Wörter
    ├── Abgeschlossene Lektionen
    └── Lernmomente
```

### Home screen priority

1. **Heute lernen**
2. **Wie viel ist heute fällig?**
3. **Wo war ich?**
4. **Mein Fortschritt**
5. Optional exploration

Do not make the homepage a dashboard of 15 metrics.

---

## 7.2 Visual progress path

Use a linear but forgiving path:

```text
Lektion 1 ✓ ── Lektion 2 ✓ ── Lektion 3 ● ── Lektion 4 ○ ── …
```

Legend:

- ✓ = abgeschlossen
- ● = aktuell
- ○ = noch nicht begonnen

Never use “failed”, “locked”, “lost”, or “reset” for normal learning variability.

---

# 8. Context, crystallized intelligence and life experience

## 8.1 What the evidence supports

Research on adult learning indicates that prior knowledge is a strong predictor of acquiring new knowledge. In a sample spanning adulthood, crystallized intelligence was directly related to learning from multimedia material, supporting the idea that accumulated knowledge can remain an important cognitive resource. citehttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16029097/

Research on learning in later life also emphasizes that real-world learning allows older adults to draw on prior knowledge, expertise, motivation and strategies built through life experience. citehttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41239-017-0055-0

A 2025 review explicitly argues that crystallized intelligence remains comparatively preserved and that older adults may rely more strongly on acquired knowledge during learning. citehttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03601277.2025.2569386

### Product strategy

Teach the new language through **known schemas**:

- travel
- shopping
- family
- work history
- cooking
- appointments
- home and neighborhood
- hobbies
- holidays
- everyday services
- conversations with family/friends

Do not assume the learner needs childish simplification. Use simple interaction design with **adult-respectful content**.

---

## 8.2 Content authoring template

Every new vocabulary item should ideally have:

```yaml
term: appointment
translation: Termin
part_of_speech: noun
example_sentence: Ich habe morgen einen Termin beim Zahnarzt.
real_life_context: Gesundheit / Alltag
pronunciation: audio
visual_association: optional image
memory_hint: optional
```

For abstract words, add:

- 1 familiar example
- 1 short contrast with a related word
- 1 contextual sentence

## 9.2 Additional Sitov standards (above WCAG AA)

These are **project requirements**, not legal WCAG thresholds:

- body text: **18px minimum**
- main task prompt: **24px minimum**
- vocabulary headword: **32px recommended**
- primary control: **56px height**
- all important controls: **48×48px target area**
- inter-control spacing: **12–16px minimum**
- text line length: **60–75ch target**, never intentionally dense
- body line-height: **1.6**
- primary instructional contrast: **prefer ≥7:1**
- one primary action per exercise
- zero mandatory drag-and-drop
- zero countdowns in ordinary learning

# 10. Component specifications

## 10.1 Primary button

```css
.learning-button {
  min-height: 56px;
  min-width: 160px;
  padding: 0.75rem 1.25rem;
  border-radius: 12px;
  font-size: 1.125rem;
  font-weight: 650;
}
```

Requirements:

- text label, not icon-only for critical actions
- clear hover, focus, active and disabled states
- focus indicator ≥2px visible outline
- not disabled merely because an answer is wrong

WCAG 2.2’s Focus Appearance AAA criteria explicitly specify a 2px-thick-perimeter-equivalent indicator and ≥3:1 change in contrast for author-defined focus indicators. citehttps://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-appearance.html

  padding: 1rem;
  margin-block: 0.75rem;
  font-size: 1.125rem;
  border-radius: 12px;
}
```

Recommended state model:

```text
idle
  ↓
selected
  ↓
submitted
  ├─ correct
  └─ needs-practice
```

Do not jump directly from `selected` to `error` while the user is still deciding.

---

## 10.3 Audio control

Minimum:

- 48×48px button
- visible speaker icon + text label at least in first-use contexts
- replay allowed without penalty
- never required for understanding essential instructions

---

## 10.4 Progress component

Show:

```text
Lektion 3
7 von 10 Aufgaben
███████░░░
```

Not:

```text
87% XP
Rank #14
−20 points
```

Progress should describe **completion**, not worth or status relative to other people.

---

# 11. Complete exercise workflow

## 11.1 Example: vocabulary retrieval

### Screen 1 — orientation

> **Heute üben wir 8 Wörter zum Thema Reisen.**

Button:

> [ Starten ]

### Screen 2 — recall

> **Was bedeutet “reservation”?**

Options.

### Screen 3 — feedback

Correct:

> **Sehr gut.**  
> reservation = Reservierung

Incorrect:

> **Noch nicht.**  
> reservation = Reservierung

Optional:

> 🔊 Anhören

### Screen 4 — next item

No celebratory modal. No forced delay.

### Screen 5 — session summary

> **Geschafft.**  
> 8 Wörter geübt  
> 6 bereits sicher  
> 2 werden später noch einmal wiederholt

Button:

> [ Fertig für heute ]

Secondary:

> [ Noch 5 Minuten üben ]

This gives autonomy without pressure.

# 12. Recommended content authoring rules

## 12.1 Vocabulary cards

For each new word, content creators should provide:

1. translation
2. natural example sentence
3. audio
4. grammatical information when relevant
5. one contextual cue
6. optional association/memory hint

Avoid dictionary-style overload on the first encounter.

---

## 12.2 Example sentences

Target:

> **Ich habe morgen einen Termin beim Arzt.**

Avoid:

> **Der Terminus “Termin” bezeichnet einen festgelegten Zeitpunkt für eine bestimmte Aktivität.**

The first is cognitively and linguistically useful. The second is semantically correct but needlessly abstract.

---

## 12.3 One concept per chunk

A new screen should not simultaneously introduce:

- five new words
- a new grammatical rule
- a new UI interaction
- an unfamiliar cultural context

Instead:

```text
Chunk 1: word meaning
Chunk 2: example
Chunk 3: retrieval
Chunk 4: sentence use
Chunk 5: spaced review
```

This is consistent with the broader evidence base around managing extraneous cognitive load through segmentation and clear signaling. citehttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013151930171X

# 13. Technical architecture validation — Stripe, Supabase SSR & Next.js caching

This section incorporates the supplied technical validation so that pedagogy, UX and implementation constraints live in one canonical document. It is intentionally more precise than the original notes where current framework behavior has evolved.

## 13.1 Stripe webhooks: raw-body verification is mandatory

Stripe requires webhook signature verification to receive the **exact raw request body** as sent by Stripe. Parsing the body as JSON and then serializing it again can alter whitespace, encoding or key representation and cause signature verification to fail. Stripe's official documentation and its current Next.js App Router example both demonstrate using the raw request body with `constructEvent()`. citehttps://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/signature?lang=node citehttps://github.com/stripe/stripe-node/blob/master/examples/webhook-signing/nextjs/app/api/webhooks/route.ts

### Canonical project implementation

For Sitov Language Academy, use a **Node.js Route Handler** for the Stripe webhook as the conservative compatibility standard:

```ts
// app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts
export const runtime = 'nodejs';

import Stripe from 'stripe';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!);

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const signature = req.headers.get('stripe-signature');
  const body = await req.text();

  if (!signature) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Missing Stripe signature' }, { status: 400 });
  }

  let event: Stripe.Event;

  try {
    event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
      body,
      signature,
      process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET!
    );
  } catch {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Invalid webhook signature' }, { status: 400 });
  }

  // Idempotent event processing follows here.
  return NextResponse.json({ received: true });
}
```

### Non-negotiable webhook rules

- Do **not** call `req.json()` before signature verification.
- Keep the webhook route isolated from generic JSON body parsing middleware.
- Persist the Stripe `event.id` and make processing idempotent so Stripe retries cannot create duplicate subscriptions, credits or entitlements.
- Verify the `Stripe-Signature` header against the environment-specific endpoint secret.
- Return a non-2xx response only when the event could not be safely authenticated/processed; authenticated events should be acknowledged quickly and long-running work should be decoupled where appropriate.

> **Important nuance:** the supplied note claimed that `stripe-node` categorically cannot run on Edge. That is too broad as a current technical statement. The safer product rule is: **use Node.js for the webhook route unless a deliberately tested Edge-compatible Stripe integration is selected**. The invariant that must never change is raw-body verification.

## 13.2 Supabase SSR + Next.js: authenticated data must remain request/user scoped

The security goal is simple: a page rendered for User A must never reuse personalized server-rendered output intended for User B. The implementation mechanism depends on the Next.js version and caching model.

Next.js currently documents two relevant models:

1. **Previous App Router caching model:** `dynamic='force-dynamic'` forces request-time rendering and is available when not using Cache Components. citehttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/caching-without-cache-components
2. **Next.js 16 Cache Components:** the framework can combine static shells with dynamic/runtime data, and the documentation explicitly says `dynamic='force-dynamic'` is not needed when Cache Components is enabled. Runtime use of APIs such as `cookies()` remains request-specific. citehttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/partial-prerendering citehttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies

### Canonical rendering rule

**Never choose a caching configuration merely because a page is called a “dashboard”. Choose it based on whether data is shared or personalized.**

For personalized student/teacher data:

```text
request
  ↓
authentication / session resolution
  ↓
resolve user_id
  ↓
fetch only records authorized for user_id
  ↓
render dynamic/personalized UI
```

The following are safe product rules:

- Session resolution must happen before user-specific data is trusted.
- Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) remains the database-level security boundary; UI routing is not a substitute for RLS.
- Never put a user-independent cache key around a query whose result contains user-specific rows.
- Never place auth/session objects themselves into a shared cache intended for multiple users.
- After mutations such as `submitVocabAnswer`, revalidate the affected UI/data path or otherwise refresh the client state so the user sees the updated phase and next-review state. Next.js supports `revalidatePath` and `revalidateTag` for this purpose. citehttps://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/mutating-data

### When the legacy explicit rule is still appropriate

If the project is using the **pre-Cache-Components model** and there is any doubt about implicit dynamic behavior, the supplied rule is valid and intentionally conservative:

```ts
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

Likewise, avoid `revalidate`/ISR on pages that contain personalized data unless the cache semantics are deliberately designed and proven user-safe. In the newer Cache Components model, the preferred architecture is more granular rather than globally disabling caching.

## 13.3 Cache taxonomy for Sitov

Use this classification when reviewing any data-fetching function:

| Data | Shared across users? | Recommended treatment |
|---|---:|---|
| Public landing-page copy | Yes | Static or cached |
| Course catalog metadata | Usually | Shared cache / static |
| Exercise definition without user state | Yes | Shared cache |
| `user_vocabulary_progress` | **No** | Request/user scoped; never shared by a generic key |
| Student streak/progress | **No** | User scoped |
| Teacher's private learner roster | **No** | Teacher/org scoped |
| Stripe customer/subscription state | **No** | Server-side user/account scoped |
| Static illustrations/audio assets | Yes | CDN/static asset caching |

## 13.4 `use cache` and private data in Next.js 16

Next.js 16 provides `use cache`, `use cache: remote` and `use cache: private` as separate mechanisms. Shared cache scopes must not directly read runtime request APIs such as `cookies()`; the preferred pattern is to resolve runtime identity outside the cache and pass the necessary user-scoped arguments into a cacheable function only when that produces a safe, explicit cache key. citehttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache

`use cache: private` exists for cases where runtime data needs to remain out of server-side shared caching, but it is documented as experimental and should not be made a production default without an explicit engineering decision. citehttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache-private

### Agent rule

> **AI coding agents must identify the Next.js version and whether `cacheComponents` is enabled before proposing a caching pattern. They must not blindly insert `dynamic='force-dynamic'` into every authenticated page.**

## 13.5 Architecture acceptance tests

Before production release, automated tests should prove at least these cases:

```text
A. Stripe
   invalid signature → 400
   valid signature + duplicate event.id → no duplicate side effect
   valid signature + known event → 2xx

B. Authentication / isolation
   user A requests dashboard → only A's progress visible
   user B requests dashboard → only B's progress visible
   user A cannot address user B's record by changing a URL/id

C. Caching
   personalized response is not served from a generic shared cache key
   vocabulary mutation is visible after submit
   logout/login cannot expose previous user's private state
```

# 14. User testing protocol — mandatory for this product

Automated accessibility tools are necessary but insufficient. W3C’s cognitive accessibility guidance explicitly recommends involving users in research and testing rather than relying solely on automated checks. citehttps://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/

## Minimum test panel

Test with at least:

- 5 users aged 50–64
- 5 users aged 65–74
- 5 users aged 75+
- mixed digital experience
- mixed vision correction needs
- tablet and desktop usage
- at least some users who are not confident with drag gestures

### Important: test the actual intended content

Do not test only generic “button-clicking” tasks. Test:

- vocabulary recall
- hearing audio and reading transcript
- error recovery
- changing text size
- continuing after interruption
- finding the next due review
- completing a lesson without assistance

# 15. Quantitative UX acceptance criteria

A release should meet all of the following before being considered successful for the target group:

| Metric | Target |
|---|---:|
| Task completion without facilitator help | ≥90% |
| Critical interaction error rate | ≤5% |
| Wrong-control activation in primary exercise | ≤3% |
| Users able to find “Continue” without prompting | ≥95% |
| Users able to change text size | ≥90% |
| Users understanding why an answer was wrong | ≥90% |
| Users can explain what happens after a difficult word | ≥85% |
| Users can resume an interrupted lesson | ≥90% |
| Subjective “interface feels stressful” | median ≤2/5 |
| Subjective confidence after a mistake | median ≥4/5 |

These are **product quality targets**, not claims about population norms.

# 17. Reference implementation: recommended product rules

## 16.1 Vocabulary scheduler

**Default schedule:**

```text
New → Phase 1 (same day)
Correct → Phase 2 (+1 day)
Correct → Phase 3 (+3 days)
Correct → Phase 4 (+9 days)
Correct → Phase 5 (+29 days)
Correct → Phase 6 (+90 days)
Correct → Long-Term Memory

Wrong → previous phase, minimum Phase 1
```

Source: phase6’s current published system description. citehttps://www.phase-six.com/presse/classic-lernen/

## 16.2 Lesson pacing

```text
Micro-task:       2–5 min
Core lesson:      8–15 min
Optional block:   20–30 min
Natural break:    every 8–15 min
```

These are **design recommendations**, not universal scientific constants.

## 16.3 Default CSS accessibility profile

```css
:root {
  --font-body: 1.125rem;
  --font-task: 1.5rem;
  --font-word: 2rem;
  --line-body: 1.6;

  --target-min: 48px;
  --button-height: 56px;
  --control-gap: 16px;
  --section-gap: 24px;

  --reading-width: 70ch;
}
```

# 18. What should NOT be overgeneralized

## 17.1 “Older people have bad memory”

Too simplistic. Age-related changes are heterogeneous. Existing knowledge, expertise and contextual support can substantially affect learning. citehttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16029097/

## 17.2 “Microlearning must be exactly 10 minutes”

Unsupported. The evidence supports short, focused chunks but does not establish one universal duration. citehttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39882484/

## 17.3 “Leitner means exactly these intervals”

Not generally. The exact schedule in this document is the **phase6 schedule**, not a universal mathematical definition of every Leitner system.

## 17.4 “Gamification is proven to work for seniors”

Evidence is encouraging but still comparatively limited and heterogeneous. Use low-pressure gamification because it fits the motivational model and avoids unnecessary stress, but validate the actual mechanics with your users. citehttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8437506/

# 19. Final master guideline

### The interface should feel like this:

> **“Ich weiß, was ich tun soll. Ich kann es in meinem Tempo tun. Wenn ich mich irre, ist das kein Problem. Die App zeigt mir, was ich brauche. Ich sehe, dass ich Fortschritte mache. Und ich weiß, was als Nächstes passiert.”**

### Therefore, the definitive product rules are:

1. **18px body text by default.**
2. **48×48px minimum target area for primary controls; 56px primary buttons.**
3. **4.5:1 AA minimum; prefer 7:1 for instructional text.**
4. **1.6 line-height and 60–75ch reading width.**
5. **Support 200% text resizing and WCAG 2.2 reflow.**
6. **No essential drag-and-drop.** Use tap-to-select alternatives.**
7. **One main task and one main action per screen.**
8. **Use the exact phase6 schedule: same day → 1 → 3 → 9 → 29 → 90 days.**
9. **Wrong answers move back one phase, not to zero.**
10. **Visualize review as strengthening, never as punishment.**
11. **Use context and prior knowledge aggressively in content design.**
12. **Prefer personal milestones, progress feedback and autonomy over competitive mechanics.**
13. **No ordinary exercise countdowns or public leaderboards.**
14. **Design lessons around 8–15 minutes, with 2–5 minute micro-activities.**
15. **Every error message must tell the learner what happened and what to do next.**
16. **Every empty state must explain itself and provide a next action.**
17. **Test with real older learners; do not validate accessibility exclusively with automated tools.**


### Robustes "Fill-in-the-Blank" (Lückensätze)
* **Auswahl-Chips statt harter Tastatureingabe:** Um Frustration durch Tippfehler auf mobilen Geräten oder Tablets zu vermeiden, werden fehlende Wörter oder Wortteile primär über kontextsensitive Tipp-Buttons (Chips) unter dem Satz per Tap eingefügt.
* **Dynamische Smart Hints:** Bei zwei aufeinanderfolgenden Fehleingaben bricht das System den Versuch nicht ab, sondern blendet einen dezenten Hinweis ein (z. B. das grammatikalische Geschlecht als farbiger Marker oder die ersten zwei Buchstaben).
* **Audio-Sofortverknüpfung:** Jedes korrekt eingesetzte oder gelöste Wort bietet direkt einen Tap-Button für das native Audio-Beispiel zur akustischen Festigung.

#### Umsetzungsstand (implementiert)
* **Eingabe:** Das freie Textfeld ist entfernt. Chips sind mindestens 64 px hoch, ihre Reihenfolge ist über einen Seed aus der Übungs-ID deterministisch — sie springt also nie um.
* **Distraktoren:** Vorrang haben die im CMS gepflegten Chips. Fehlen sie, entstehen die Ablenker aus derselben Wortfamilie (sein, haben, Modalverben, Artikel, Pronomen, Präpositionen), damit die Auswahl eine echte Grammatik-Entscheidung bleibt und kein Ratespiel wird.
* **Fehlerkultur:** Ein falsch getippter Chip wird ausgegraut und aus dem Spiel genommen; die Aufgabe bleibt offen, bis sie gelöst ist. Es gibt kein rotes Fehler-Feedback, keinen Timer und keine Bestenliste.
* **Smart Hints (zweistufig):** Ab 2 Fehlversuchen Wortart bzw. Genus (der Genus-Hinweis erscheint nur, wenn die Lücke selbst kein Artikel ist — sonst wäre die Lösung verraten). Ab 3 Fehlversuchen Anfangsbuchstabe und Wortlänge.
* **Audio:** Nach dem Lösen stehen zwei Tap-Buttons bereit — für das Wort und für den ganzen Satz. Fallback-Kette: gepflegte MP3 → Audio aus der Vokabelbank → Sprachausgabe des Geräts (de-DE, Tempo 0.9).
* **Persistenz:** Jeder Versuch wird in `user_exercise_progress` fortgeschrieben (`attempts`, `hint_shown`), damit Hinweise einen Reload überleben und die Lehrkraft Problemstellen erkennt.

### Asynchrones Sprachfeedback (Lehrer-Schüler-Loop)
* **Visuelle Waveforms:** Sprachnachrichten (sowohl Schüler-Einreichungen als auch das Lehrer-Feedback) werden in der UI mit einer cleanen, modernen Waveform-Tonspur dargestellt, um Übersicht und Orientierung zu bieten.
* **Kontextuelles Feedback:** Lehrkräfte können Feedback ideal direkt an konkrete Einreichungen oder Passagen knüpfen, sodass Lernende im besten Alter genau wissen, welcher Laut oder Satzteil besprochen wird.
* **Motivierende In-App-Benachrichtigungen:** Sobald das Lehrer-Feedback in der Live-Datenbank bereitgestellt wird, erscheint auf dem Start-Dashboard ein freundlicher, unaufdringlicher Hinweis ("Du hast eine Sprachnachricht erhalten").

#### Umsetzungsstand (implementiert)
* **Tonspur:** Die Waveform besteht aus 48 Balken. Je Abschnitt wird der Spitzenwert genommen, nicht der Mittelwert — bei Sprache ergäbe der Mittelwert eine flache, nichtssagende Linie. Anschließend wird auf den lautesten Balken normalisiert, damit eine leise Aufnahme genauso deutlich aussieht wie eine laute. Auch Stille behält eine Mindesthöhe, sodass die Spur nie leer wirkt.
* **Während der Aufnahme** läuft die Spur mit (`AnalyserNode`, ein Balken je ~110 ms). Sie füllt sich von links und scrollt erst, wenn sie voll ist — eine kurze Aufnahme sieht dadurch nicht wie eine fast leere Fläche aus. Darunter steht die verstrichene Zeit als `m:ss`.
* **Bei der Wiedergabe** färbt sich der bereits gehörte Teil orange. Ein Tap auf die Spur springt an diese Stelle, Pfeiltasten springen fünf Sekunden. Umsetzung als Balken-`div`s statt Canvas: scharf auf Retina-Displays ohne Zusatzlogik und mit echter ARIA-Semantik (`role="slider"`, `aria-valuetext` mit Zeitangabe).
* **Bedienung:** Der Play-Button ist 64 px groß, das Tempo lässt sich zwischen 1×, 0,75× und 1,25× umschalten — 0,75× ist für das Nachsprechen einer Korrektur oft wichtiger als die Originalgeschwindigkeit.
* **Ein Loop, nicht zwei:** Die Korrektur läuft ausschließlich über `/admin/submissions`. Die frühere zweite Lehrer-Ansicht unter `/admin/feedback` konnte nur Text-Feedback und hat zu widersprüchlichen Ständen geführt; sie leitet jetzt dauerhaft um.
* **Benachrichtigung:** `teacher_feedback.seen_at` trägt den Gelesen-Status. Auf dem Dashboard erscheint eine erklärende Karte mit großem Ziel-Button, die direkt auf das betroffene Sprachniveau verlinkt — bewusst kein roter Zähler am Menüpunkt, der für unsere Zielgruppe eher Unruhe als Orientierung stiftet. Die „Neu"-Markierung bleibt für den laufenden Seitenaufruf sichtbar und verschwindet nicht unter den Augen des Lernenden.
* **Beim Rollout** gilt Feedback, das älter als sieben Tage ist, als gesehen. Ohne diese Grenze hätte jeder Schüler beim ersten Aufruf eine Flut alter Hinweise bekommen.
* **Fehlerkultur:** Verweigerte Mikrofon-Freigabe, ein Browser ohne Aufnahmefähigkeit und ein fehlgeschlagener Upload haben je eine eigene, ruhige Erklärung in Alltagssprache — jeweils mit dem Hinweis, dass es nicht am Lernenden lag. Die aufgenommene Datei bleibt bei einem gescheiterten Upload erhalten, ein zweiter Versuch kostet nur einen Tap.

## Changelog (Protokoll)

### 2026-09-06 — Audio-Wiedergabe: Player-Robustheit & deutsche TTS
- **Sprachnachrichten hörbar machen:** `WaveformPlayer` prüft das Format vorab (`canPlayType`), zeigt sichtbare Fehlermeldungen mit Retry statt stiller Fehlschläge, hat einen Ladezustand und behebt die `Infinity`-Dauer von webm-Aufnahmen. Häufigste Ursache für „man hört nichts": webm-Aufnahmen sind auf Safari/iOS nicht abspielbar – jetzt erscheint dazu ein klarer Hinweis (echte Cross-Browser-Wiedergabe erfordert serverseitige Transkodierung, bewusst als Folgeschritt notiert).
- **Deutsche Aussprache (TTS):** Zentraler Helfer `lib/audio/speech.ts` setzt explizit eine `de-DE`-Stimme (mit Browser-Fallback über `utterance.lang`), cached Stimmen über `voiceschanged` (mobile Geräte laden sie verzögert) und startet die Ausgabe synchron/autoplay-sicher aus dem Klick-Handler. Genutzt im Vokabeltrainer und in den Grammatik-/Lückentext-Übungen.
- **i18n:** `audio_loading`, `audio_retry`, `audio_format_unsupported` in allen fünf Sprachen.
- QS: `tsc --noEmit` fehlerfrei, Übersetzungs-/Waveform-Tests grün; kein `any`, keine DB-/Server-Action-Änderungen.

### 2026-09-06 — Vokabeltrainer: „Lernkasten"-System zur Lektionsauswahl
- **Vom Pauschal-Lernen zur Kuratierung:** „Vokabeln lernen" öffnet jetzt eine Zusammenstellungsansicht mit interaktivem Lernkasten (Selection-Box) oben und einer Übersicht aller Lektionen des Niveaus darunter. Lektionen werden per Klick oder Drag & Drop in den Lernkasten gelegt; nur deren fällige Vokabeln fließen in die aktive Lerneinheit.
- **Transparente Zahl:** Der Lernkasten zeigt dynamisch „{Lektionen} ausgewählt – {Vokabeln}", wobei die Vokabelzahl den heute fälligen, tatsächlich zu lernenden Karten entspricht. Lektionen ohne fällige Vokabeln sind sichtbar, aber nicht wählbar.
- **Persistenz:** Auswahl je Niveau im `localStorage` (`sitov_lernkasten:{level}`), damit die Zusammenstellung Reload und Wiederkehr übersteht (gerätegebunden, kein Server-State). Erstbesuch = alle fälligen Lektionen (nicht-brechend), danach frei anpassbar.
- **Struktur:** Kartensession nach `VocabCardSession.tsx` ausgelagert, `VocabTrainerClient.tsx` orchestriert `compose`/`train`. 18 neue `lernkasten_*`-i18n-Keys in allen fünf Sprachen.
- QS: `tsc --noEmit` fehlerfrei, Übersetzungs-Integritätstest grün; kein `any`, keine DB-/Server-Action-Änderungen.

### 2026-09-06 — Vokabeltrainer: Sofortiger Kartenwechsel & Tinder-Pre-Rendering
- **Keine Bestätigungsmeldung mehr:** Nach der Selbsteinschätzung („Wusste ich" / „Wusste ich nicht") entfällt die Zwischenmeldung samt „Nächste Karte"-Button; die nächste Karte wird sofort aktiv. Das Speichern des Lernstands läuft fire-and-forget im Hintergrund (Kartenwechsel wartet nicht darauf). Fehler weiterhin als dezenter, nicht-blockierender Hinweis (Graceful Degradation).
- **Pacing-Hinweis:** Der Lernende steuert das Tempo weiterhin selbst — über den Zeitpunkt des Aufdeckens und der Bewertung. Der zuvor dokumentierte „kein automatischer Kartenwechsel"-Zwischenschritt entfällt zugunsten eines flüssigeren Flows ohne unnötige Klicks.
- **Tinder-Pre-Rendering:** Aktuelle und nächste Karte liegen gleichzeitig im DOM (CSS-Grid-Stapel), Bilder von `i+1`/`i+2` werden vorgeladen. Exit-Animation ~260 ms (rechts = gewusst, links = nicht), `prefers-reduced-motion` respektiert.
- QS: `tsc --noEmit` fehlerfrei; kein `any`, keine DB-/Server-Action-Änderungen.

### 2026-09-06 — Globale UI-Fixes: Padding, keine Silbentrennung, Niveau-Farbcodierung
- **Silbentrennung aus:** Globale `p`-Regel in `app/globals.css` von `text-justify hyphens-auto` auf `text-left` + `hyphens: none` (+ `-webkit-`/`-ms-`) + `overflow-wrap: break-word` umgestellt. Grund: Automatische Trennung zerschnitt Wörter an unnatürlichen Stellen – für die Zielgruppe irritierend und schlechter lesbar. Blocksatz entfernt, damit keine Wortlücken/Rivers entstehen.
- **Mehr Padding:** Hinweis-/Empty-State-Container (u.a. „Für dieses Sprachniveau gibt es noch keine Lernsets…") und Trainer-Kartenflächen haben jetzt rundum ausreichenden Innenabstand (`p-6`/`p-8`/`sm:p-12` statt knappem `py-12`/`p-5`), damit Text nicht am Rand klebt.
- **Niveau-Farbcodierung statt Abdunklung:** Höhere Niveaus wirkten durch zunehmend dunklere Icons wie deaktiviert. Neu: `levelVisual(levelId)` in `lib/vocabulary-ui.ts` gibt jeder CEFR-Stufe eine eigene, elegante Farbwelt (A frisch: Smaragd/Himmelblau · B kräftig: Orange/Rosé · C edel: Violett/Gold) plus klar lesbares Niveau-Badge. `tailwind.config.ts` scannt dafür jetzt auch `./lib/**`.
- QS: `tsc --noEmit` fehlerfrei; kein `any`, keine DB-/Server-Action-Änderungen.

### 2026-09-03 — Vokabel-Modal: Scroll-Fix, Tabs, eigene Vokabeln & Phasen-Diagramm
- **Scroll:** Dialog `max-h-[calc(100vh-6rem)] flex flex-col`; Header `flex-shrink-0`; Body `flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-y-auto overscroll-contain` plus `.modal-scroll-region` (`-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`). `data-lenis-prevent` am Dialog, damit Lenis Trackpad-/Mausrad-Gesten nicht schluckt.
- **Tabs:** Wörterliste und Phasen-Verteilung (`role="tablist"`), Texte in `dictionaries/{de,en,ru,uk,tr}.json`.
- **Eigene Vokabeln:** Clientseitig in `localStorage` (`lib/vocabulary-custom.ts`), Start in Phase 1, sofort in Liste und Statistik. Kein Server-Persistenz-Pfad, bewusst getrennt vom Leitner-Trainer.
- **Phasen-Diagramm:** Tailwind-Balken Phase 1–6 + Gelernt, Anzahl über dem Balken, farbliche Labels, gewichteter Gesamtfortschritt (`computePhaseDistribution`).
- QS: `tsc --noEmit` fehlerfrei, neue Unit-Tests grün.

### 2026-09-03 — Rücknahme No-Scroll-Layout, Trainer-Feinschliff & Textfix „Lektion Lektion 2"
- **Rücknahme starre Viewport-Sperre:** Das im Eintrag darunter beschriebene `lg:h-[calc(100vh-5rem)] lg:overflow-hidden`-Muster verursachte auf MacBook/Laptop-Displays abgeschnittene Inhalte und blockiertes Trackpad-Scrollen. In allen sechs Trainer-Seiten (`vocabulary`, `vocabulary/train`, `vocabulary/assess`, `pronunciation`, `exercises`, `videos`) entfernt und durch flexible Container (`min-h-screen w-full py-8`, natürliches `overflow-y-auto`-Scrollverhalten des Browsers) ersetzt.
- **Karteikarten-Trainer:** `VocabTrainerClient.tsx` kompakter gestaltet (kleinere Innenabstände/Bildgröße); `vocabulary/train/page.tsx` zentriert die Karte über `flex flex-1 items-center justify-center` (mit `min-h-`, nicht `h-`) vertikal, ohne Clipping-Risiko – bei zu wenig Platz scrollt die Seite einfach.
- **Aussprache-Trainer:** Kopf, Hero-Karte, Recorder und „Deine bisherigen Einreichungen" bilden jetzt einen einzigen natürlich fließenden Block; die Einreichungen stehen unter der Aufnahme-Box.
- **Textfix „Lektion Lektion 2":** Neue Hilfsfunktion `stripLessonPrefix()` (`lib/utils.ts`) entfernt ein bereits in den Rohdaten enthaltenes führendes „Lektion", bevor die `lesson_label`-Übersetzung ihr eigenes Präfix davorsetzt. Angewendet in `VocabTrainerClient.tsx`, `LessonAssessmentClient.tsx`, `videos/page.tsx` (×2) und `videos/[id]/page.tsx`.
- **Vokabeltrainer-Übersicht:** Leerer „0%"-Fortschrittsbalken in `LessonList.tsx` entfernt (nur noch sichtbar, wenn `stat.learned > 0`).
- **Vokabel-Modal:** `LessonCardsModal.tsx` auf `max-h-[80vh]` begrenzt; Listbereich mit explizitem `flex-1 overflow-y-auto` statt fester `max-h-[400px]`.
- QS: `tsc --noEmit` fehlerfrei, `jest` 446/446 (ohne den vorbestehenden, umgebungsabhängigen DB-Integrationstest), `next build` erfolgreich.

### 2026-09-03 — Unified Siri-Waveform, Vokabeltrainer-Bugfix, No-Scroll-Layout & Re-Branding
- **`FluidWaveform`:** Die Canvas-Siri-Wave aus `LiveWaveform` wurde in eine eigenständige, wiederverwendbare Komponente (`components/audio/FluidWaveform.tsx`) extrahiert – datenquellen-agnostisch über eine `getVolume(): number`-Callback-Prop. `WaveformPlayer` (Wiedergabe fertiger Aufnahmen) nutzt sie jetzt ebenfalls statt der alten `div`-Balken; die Wellenbewegung während der Wiedergabe ist eine bewusste, überlagerte Sinus-Simulation statt eines echten `AnalyserNode` am `<audio>`-Element (Stummschaltungs-/CORS-Risiko vermieden, von der Aufgabenstellung explizit als Alternative erlaubt). Seek-Funktion (Klick, Pfeiltasten, `role="slider"`) bleibt vollständig erhalten. Tote Balken-Funktionen (`extractPeaks`, `normalizePeaks`, `barHeightPercent`) und ihre Tests entfernt.
- **Bugfix grauer Balken:** Der Lern-Fortschrittsbalken in `LessonList.tsx` stand ohne grüne Füllung wie ein eingefrorener Platzhalter direkt neben „Vokabeln anzeigen". Jetzt unterhalb der Lektions-Kennzahlen, getrennt von der Button-Reihe, mit Prozent-Anzeige.
- **Vokabeltrainer-Redesign:** Die aufklappende Inline-Vokabelliste ist einem Modal (`components/vocabulary/LessonCardsModal.tsx`, `max-h-[400px] overflow-y-auto`, ESC/Klick-außerhalb schließt) gewichen – kein endlos wachsendes Akkordeon mehr.
- **No-Scroll-Viewport (Desktop `lg:`):** Alle sechs Trainer-Hauptrouten (`vocabulary`, `vocabulary/train`, `vocabulary/assess`, `pronunciation`, `exercises`, `videos`) nutzen ab `lg:` `h-[calc(100vh-5rem)] overflow-hidden flex flex-col` mit fixem Kopfbereich und genau einem intern scrollenden Inhaltsbereich (`flex-1 overflow-y-auto`). Mobile (`< lg`) scrollt weiterhin normal.
- **Re-Branding:** Alle 22 Textvorkommen von „SmartGerman" im Repository durch „Sitov Academy" ersetzt (Komponenten, Dictionaries, Alt-Texte, Cursor-Rules, SQL-Kommentare, Doku). `package.json`, Supabase-Projekt-ID und der externe Telegram-Link `t.me/smartgerman_hannover` bleiben unverändert.
- QS: `tsc --noEmit` fehlerfrei, `jest` 446/446 (ohne den vorbestehenden, umgebungsabhängigen DB-Integrationstest), `next build` erfolgreich.

### 2026-09-03 — Supabase-Browser-Client-Fix & Siri-Style Live-Waveform
- Ursache für „@supabase/ssr: Your project's URL and API key are required...“ gefunden: `utils/supabase/client.ts` las die `NEXT_PUBLIC_`-Variablen über eine Hilfsfunktion (`readSupabasePublicConfig()`), die Next.js im Browser-Bundle nicht zur Build-Zeit ersetzen kann (nur wortwörtlicher `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_XXX`-Zugriff wird ersetzt). Serverseitig fiel es nie auf, da dort ein echtes `process.env` existiert.
- Fix: direkter, literaler `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*`-Zugriff in `client.ts`, saubere Validierung mit `console.error` + neuem typisierten `SupabaseConfigError` statt unkontrolliertem Absturz; `lib/audio/upload.ts` erkennt diesen Fehler gezielt (`reason: 'not_configured'`). Neuer Test `__tests__/supabase-client.test.ts`.
- Funktioniert unverändert plattformunabhängig (Vercel „Shared“ Env Vars, Netlify `@netlify/plugin-nextjs`, lokal `.env.local`) – Variablen müssen nur zur Build-Zeit gesetzt sein.
- `components/audio/LiveWaveform.tsx` von starren DOM-Balken auf eine flüssige Canvas-Siri-Wave umgestellt: drei phasenverschobene Sinus-Wellen, live gespeist aus dem `AnalyserNode` (Web Audio API) über `requestAnimationFrame`, weich geglättet über neue Funktion `smoothTowards()` (`lib/audio/waveform.ts`, mit Tests). Warmer Orange-Glow passend zum Markendesign; respektiert `prefers-reduced-motion`; räumt sich über `cancelAnimationFrame`/`ResizeObserver.disconnect()` selbst auf.
- `useAudioRecorder.ts` gibt dafür `analyserRef` nach außen frei; `AudioRecorder.tsx` und `PendingSubmissionCard.tsx` reichen ihn durch. `WaveformPlayer` (fertige Aufnahme, Seek-Leiste) blieb an diesem Tag zunächst unverändert Balken-basiert – wurde im selben Tages-Batch aber noch auf `FluidWaveform` umgestellt, siehe Eintrag „Unified Siri-Waveform" oben.

### 2026-09-03 — Audio-Upload-Fehler behoben (Aussprache-Training)
- Fehlermeldung „Die Aufnahme konnte gerade nicht hochgeladen werden“ zurückverfolgt auf zwei Ursachen in `lib/audio/upload.ts`: vollen MIME-Type inkl. Codec-Parameter als `Content-Type` gesendet, und zu knappes Fehler-Logging ohne Bucket/Pfad/Statuscode.
- Neue Funktion `baseMimeType()` normalisiert auf `audio/webm` bzw. `audio/mp4` vor dem Storage-Upload; `upload()` läuft mit `upsert: true`.
- Strukturiertes `console.error`-Logging für jeden Fehlerpfad (Sitzung, Storage, Netzwerk) in `upload.ts` und `AudioRecorder.tsx`.
- Bucket-Name im Code (`audio_submissions`) gegen Live-Projekt verifiziert – bereits korrekt, kein Rename nötig.
- RLS-Migration `supabase/migrations/fix_audio_submissions_storage_policies.sql` (idempotent) live ausgeführt: Bucket + INSERT/UPDATE/SELECT-Policies neu bestätigt.

### 2026-09-03 — Vokabeltrainer A1.1 Lektion 3 (Einkauf & Lebensmittel)
- Einkauf, Lebensmittel, Geschäfte, Mengen und Redemittel (76 Karten) wurden aus A1.1 Lektion 2 in die eigenständige **Lektion 3** überführt.
- A1.1 Lektion 2 fokussiert nun sauber auf Befinden, Familie, Pronomen und Zahlen 0–20 (85 Karten).
- Live-DB Migration `move_einkauf_vocab_to_a11_lektion_3.sql` via Supabase API ausgeführt; alle Lernfortschritte in `user_vocabulary_progress` blieben 100% erhalten.
- Seed-Dateien synchronisiert (`supabase/seeds/a11_lektion_2_familie.sql`, `a11_lektion_3_einkauf.sql`).

### 2026-09-02 — Smartphone-UX-Agent
- Neuer Cursor-Agent `.cursor/rules/ux-smartphone-agent.mdc`: Mobile-First-Layout (320/375px), Stapeln unter `md:`, Safe-Area, 16px-Inputs gegen iOS-Zoom, kein Horizontal-Scroll. Ergänzt `ux-geragogik-agent.mdc` (Alter/Barrierefreiheit), ersetzt ihn nicht.

### 2026-09-02 — Vokabeltrainer A1.1 befüllt
- Demo-Set „Schritte plus neu“ entfernt. Neu: Lernsets **Lektion 1** (Begrüßung, Personen, Herkunft, Länder, Sprachen, Formular) und **Lektion 2** (Befinden, Familie, Zahlen, Lebensmittel, Einkaufen).
- Jede Karte hat Übersetzungen auf Russisch, Türkisch und Englisch; kontrastiv schwere Nomen (Artikel, Umlaut-Plural) sind für Leitner markiert.

### 2026-09-02 — Authentifizierung Live-Betrieb
- Auth- und Stripe-Redirects nutzen `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (`getSiteUrl` / `buildPublicUrl`), keine hartcodierte `http://localhost:3000`.
- `/auth/confirm` und `/auth/callback` verifizieren PKCE (`code`) und OTP (`token_hash`) und leiten nach Erfolg direkt auf `/{lang}/dashboard`.
- Produktions-ENVs: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` (Alias `SUPABASE_URL`), `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (Alias `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`).

### 2026-09-02 — Authentifizierung produktionsreif
- Bestätigungslinks zeigen auf `https://www.sitov-academy.com/auth/confirm`, nicht auf localhost.
- `/auth/confirm` ist von Locale-Redirects ausgenommen; Token-Hash-Templates ermöglichen die Bestätigung auf einem anderen Gerät (Geragogik).
- Anmelde- und Registrierungsseiten folgen den Geragogik-Maßen (18px Fließtext, 24px Titel, min. 56px Felder und Knöpfe), ohne Timer und ohne Fachbegriffe.

### 2026-09-02 — Supabase MCP & Schema-Sync
- **Projekt-Binding:** Ausschließlich Supabase-Projekt `wcaslabeiwtvygxtzcio` (Sitov Academy v2).
- **Agent-Regeln (`.cursorrules`):** SQL-Output-Pflicht entfernt; stattdessen Live-DB-Schutz, MCP-basierte Migrationen, Schema-Sync-Pflicht.
- **`supabase/schema.sql`:** Ergänzt um Funktionen (`handle_new_user`, `handle_registration_confirmation`), Trigger, RLS-Policies, Indizes und Unique-Constraints — abgeglichen mit Live-DB.
- **`supabase/database.types.ts`:** Neu generiert; Supabase-Clients typisiert.
